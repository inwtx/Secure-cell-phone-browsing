Instructions on how to setup secure browsing on a cell phone with Firefox and ConnectBot.  
  
To prevent Google, your phone company, and any wifi location you use from spying on your web browsing, you need to use a personally owned server, an SSH service, a rented Virtual Private Server service, or a Virtual Private Network service.  Although there are some VPNs in the Google Play Store that are available for use with your phone, it is assumed to they are scraping information from your web browsing. 
  
This spying can be circumvented with the use of the android Firefox client and the SSH ConnectBot client.  As long as you can obtain the remote server's IP address and its web server port (usually 80), then you can use these two apps to securely brows the internet anywhere. Firefox is currently the only browser that allows you to change its proxy settings, whereby you can connect to/through ConnectBot.
